---HYPERMEDIA PROJECT---

We developed the website using Bootstrap framework. Notice that we implemented the website in a way that all links can be clicked but only one per page is completely implemented. These one are often marked with a glyphicon (hand-right) that spot the correct link.

The IDMs are located in the folder 'IDM schema'. We didn't placed the whole github project in a single folder 'WEBSITE' due to internet issues.
