                <p style="margin: 5%"><b>The Italian telecommunications market</b><br>
                    The Italian TLC market continues to be highly competitive with significant use of the pricing as a lever,
                    which has led to an ongoing impoverishment of the traditional service components, particularly voice service.
                    In this context, the key element in the evolution of the market has been the increased penetration of broadband,
                    first fixed and now also mobile, and above all greater penetration of new generation handsets. At the same time,
                    the evolution of the competitive scenario continues to veer towards a situation of increased complexity,
                    with more inter relationships between players of different markets, opening the field to the competition
                    of non-traditional operators,  particularly OTTs (Over the Top) companies and producers of electronic and
                    consumer devices), as well as giving telecommunication operators the possibility of developing new so-called
                    “network based” services (mainly in the IT and Media fields).
                    For the telecommunications operators, in addition to the core competition from the other traditional operators in the sector,
                    the field has been invaded by OTTs and device producers who take advantage of their full understanding of the evolution of consumer
                    trends, consumer electronics and software environments and who operate entirely in the digital world, basing their behavior on
                    competition approaches that are completely different to those of TLC players. Conversely, with regard to the positioning of the
                    telecommunications operators in the converging markets, it should be noted that there are, at varying levels of development:
                    > initiatives to enter IT market of innovative services by expanding Cloud services from the business to the consumer world
                    > new wireless applications such as Machine-to- Machine and mobile payment
                    > significant presence as facilitators of online digital content use on the living room screen using Over The Top TV multidevice solutions.</p>

                <p style="margin: 5%"><b>Competition in fixed telecommunications</b><br>
                    The fixed-line telecommunications market continues to see a significant decline in voice revenues due to the reduction in rates and the progressive shift of voice traffic to mobile. In recent years all the operators have attempted to at least partially counter this phenomenon by concentrating mainly on the ability to innovate their offering by developing the penetration of Broadband and introducing bundled voice, broadband and services deals (double play), in a highly competitive environment with consequent pricing pressure.
                    The evolution of the competitive product offering has also been influenced by consolidation, among competitors, of an approach based on the control of infrastructure (above all Local Loop Unbundling - LLU). The main fixed operators are now also offering mobile services, also as Mobile Virtual Operators (MVOs).
                    In 2014, the migration of customers from fixed-line to mobile telephony services continued, as well as the migration to alternative communications solutions (Voice Over IP, messaging, e-mail and social network chat). For years, both for private consumers and small and medium businesses, mature traditional voice services have been replaced by value-added content and services based on the Internet protocol. This shift has been facilitated by the use of the Internet and changes in user preferences, by the spread of broadband, personal computers and other connected devices, and by the quality of the service.
                    The competitive scenario in the Italian fixed telecommunications market is characterized by the presence, in addition to Telecom Italia, of a number of operators such as Wind-Infostrada, Fastweb, Vodafone-TeleTu, BT Italia and Tiscali, that have different business models focused on different segments of the market.
                    At December 31, 2014, fixed accesses in Italy totaled approximately 20.6 million (including infrastructured OLOs and Fixed Wireless Access), down from 2013. The growing competition in the access market has led to a gradual reduction in Telecom Italia's market share.
                    In the broadband market, at December 31, 2014 fixed broadband customers in Italy reached a penetration rate on fixed accesses of about 69%. The spread of broadband is driven not only by the penetration of personal computers and other enabled devices (e.g. Smart TVs), but also by the growing demand for speed and access to new IP based services (Voice over IP, Content – particularly Video, social networking services, etc.). The decline continued in revenues from the data transmission segment, which suffered the effects of competition that has led to reduction in average prices.
                    <br><b>Competition in mobile telecommunications</b><br>
                    The mobile market, which is saturated and mature in its traditional component of voice services, has experienced a decline in the number of lines, due to the rationalization of second and third SIM cards (at December 31, 2014, mobile lines in Italy numbered about 94 million, down by about 3% over 2013, which still represents a very high penetration rate of the population, of approximately 157%).
                    Revenues from traditional service components, such as voice and messaging, continued to decline, as these components are impacted by the strong competition between TLC operators based on pricing as a lever – which was particularly intense in 2013 but with signs of a slowdown in the second half of 2014 – in addition to the increasing spread of "communication apps". Mobile Broadband continues to grow and, although it is unable to offset the drop in revenues from traditional services, it represents the main
                    strategic and business opportunity for the mobile TLC industry, also due to the launch of LTE Ultra Broadband.
                    In 2014, the growth in mobile broadband customers continued, both large and small screen, with a high penetration rate on mobile lines, especially as a result of the increasing spread of smartphones and tablets. Alongside innovative services that have already caught on and are under full-scale development, as in the case of mobile apps, there are other market environments, associated with the development of mobile broadband, with major potential for growth in the medium term, such as machine to machine and mobile payment.
                    The competitive scenario in the Italian mobile telecommunications market is dominated by Telecom Italia and also by the infrastructured operators (Vodafone, Wind*, H3G*) which are focused on different segments of the market or have different strategies.
                    In addition to these operators, the field also includes mobile virtual operators (MVO), of which PosteMobile is the most important player. These operators currently have a limited share of the market, but continue to enjoy significant growth compared to infrastructured operators.</p>
